I am a Research Associate at the Wellcome Sanger Insitute with [Prof. Nicole Soranzo](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/soranzo-nicole/), after recentluy finishing my PhD at the University of Cambridge and the European Bioinformatics Institute, under the joint supervision of [Oliver Stegle](https://www.embl.org/groups/stegle/) and [John Marioni](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/john-marioni) (2020). 
My research interests lie in the fields of statistical genetics, computational biology, single cell genomics, and machine learning. 
My PhD work was concerned with the development of integrative statistical models to link DNA variants to single cell expression profiles, to uncover molecular mechanisms that might help us interpret and unravel the genotype-phenotype map. 
I have contributed to the analysis of datasets from the HipSci (Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative) and the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) projects, and am a member of the single-cell eQTLGen Consortium. 
Previously, I obtained my Master’s in Computer Science, track Bioinformatics from the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, and Bachelor’s degree in Mathematical Engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Italy. 

I will shortly be relocating for a post-doctoral position at the Garvan Institute in Sydney, Australia under the joint supervision of Professors Joseph Powell and Daniel MacArthur, with an interest in developing further methods for statistical genetics using single-cell genomic data. 
Eventually, I hope to apply these methods to study the genetic contribution and phenotypic variability of disease states including Parkinson's disease and diabetes. 
In the future, I hope to translate these findings into novel therapeutic interventions and diagnostics for patients.
